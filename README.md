# TaskMate - Hostel Task Marketplace

TaskMate is a peer-to-peer task marketplace designed specifically for hostel communities. This project has been in my mind for a very long time, and bringing it to life feels like a win!

---

## 🎯 The Idea

Imagine a platform just for your hostel, where students can:

- **Post tasks** they need help with—like ironing clothes, making assignments, cooking, or even renting out clothes/shoes/jewelry.
- **Browse and accept tasks** posted by others, selecting work they want to do.
- **Get paid** for completing tasks via UPI, cash, cards, or net banking.
- **Build a micro-economy** within the hostel, encouraging collaboration and community.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **User Registration & Login:** Secure authentication for all hostel residents.
- **Task Posting:** Post any job—household chores, academic help, rentals, shopping, and more—with details and your offered price.
- **Task Browsing:** Instantly see all open tasks from your peers, filter by category or search by keywords.
- **Task Acceptance:** Accept any available task; once accepted, it’s reserved for you.
- **My Tasks Dashboard:** See the tasks you’ve posted and the ones you’ve accepted in a personalized dashboard.
- **Payments (interface):** Agree to pay and get paid via UPI, cash, cards, or net banking (integration in progress).
- **Responsive Design:** Looks great on mobile and desktop.
- **Profile Section:** User avatar and basic info in the header.
- **Category Filtering:** Laundry, Academic, Cooking, Rental, Cleaning, Shopping, Other.
- **Statistics:** At-a-glance view of total posted and accepted tasks.
- **Modern UI:** Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide Icons.

## 💡 Why TaskMate?

This project is the result of a long-standing dream to create a self-sustaining, collaborative community within my hostel. By connecting students who need tasks done with those willing to earn, TaskMate empowers everyone to help and be helped—fostering both convenience and a sense of belonging.
